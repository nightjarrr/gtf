Current version: 0.1

Roadmap for the future:

0.2		Complex logical expressions based on tags and actor names in fact's definition.

0.2.2	Support for grammatic declension of actor's name in the fact definition.

0.3		Support for multiple actors in the fact. Rules for actors cannot reference other actors in the facts.

0.4		Support for cross-actor rules. (Rule for actor A depends on some characteristics of actor B)

0.6		Support for multiple attributes for actor. *Possibly* this will lead to differentiation of actors into classes (People, Colors, etc..)
